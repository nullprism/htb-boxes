# HTB-BOXES

Code snippets and POCs I use for HTB Box popping. Post modification.

If you find something here that isn't credited the way it should be, please please please let me know, and I will address it immediately. I am claiming none of this work as my own, unless it is specifically stated, this is merely a collection of scripts I've modified from skilled authors for box engagements. In all cases of python2, I've made best effort to convert the syntax and dependencies to python3 for sanity - if I failed, I'll annotate it.
